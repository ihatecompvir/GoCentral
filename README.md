# GoCentral
A Rock Band 3 master server re-implementation written in Golang using MongoDB as the database layer and my Quazal Rendez-vous-compatible forks of [nex-go](https://github.com/ihatecompvir/nex-go)/[nex-protocols-go](https://github.com/ihatecompvir/nex-protocols-go) as the underlying server layer. 

Note that this only aims to replicate what the game calls "Rock Central", support for the Music Store is _not_ here and will never be added. Just buy the songs through the Xbox Live Marketplace or PlayStation Store instead.
